## 4. Brand Voice & Tone

### 4.1 Voice Characteristics

**Our brand voice is**:

1. **Clear and Results-Oriented**: "Submit 10 qualified leads per week and earn up to 250€" not "Leverage your network to generate revenue streams"

2. **Professional yet Approachable**: "Your leads are reviewed within 24 hours" not "We'll get back to you soon" or "Lead assessment protocols execute on a pre-determined cadence"

3. **Transparent and Honest**: "50% commission on sold leads, paid weekly" not "Competitive rates" or hidden fee structures

4. **Empowering and Action-Focused**: "Start earning from your network today" not "Consider joining our community of scouts"

**Our brand voice is NOT**:
1. **Overly Casual or Playful**: Avoid "Hey buddy!" or excessive emojis - this is professional B2B
2. **Corporate Jargon-Heavy**: No "synergies," "paradigm shifts," or "disruptive ecosystems"
3. **Passive or Vague**: Never "leads may be verified" - always "leads are verified within 24 hours"
4. **Overly Aggressive**: Not "Make money NOW!" - we're confident, not desperate

### 4.2 Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Scout Homepage Hero | Motivating, opportunity-focused | "Turn every business conversation into revenue. Earn 12.50-25€ per qualified lead." |
| Company Homepage Hero | Problem-solving, trustworthy | "Stop wasting budget on cold leads. Get human-verified B2B prospects from professional scouts." |
| Lead Rejection Notification | Constructive, educational | "This lead didn't meet quality criteria: missing budget timeline. Here's how to improve your next submission." |
| Payout Confirmation | Celebratory, reinforcing | "250€ on the way! You've sold 10 leads this week. Keep up the great work." |
| Onboarding (Scouts) | Encouraging, clear expectations | "Welcome! Complete your profile and submit your first lead within 48 hours to unlock earnings." |
| Error Messages | Helpful, solution-oriented | "Upload failed. Check your connection and try again, or contact support if the issue persists." |
| Pricing Page (Companies) | Confident, value-focused | "499€/month for 50 qualified leads - that's 9.98€ per lead vs. 75€+ average cost per click." |
| Quality Score Explanation | Educational, transparent | "Your quality score (8.2/10) is based on lead conversion rate, data completeness, and buyer feedback." |

### 4.3 Writing Guidelines

**Do**:
- Lead with specific outcomes and numbers ("Earn 500-2000€/month" not "Earn extra income")
- Use active voice ("Scouts submit leads" not "Leads are submitted by scouts")
- Address users directly ("Your network" not "The scout's network")
- Provide concrete timelines ("Reviewed in 24 hours" not "Reviewed quickly")
- Explain the "why" behind processes ("We verify company size to ensure lead relevance")
- Use bullet points for scannability
- Front-load key information (inverted pyramid style)

**Don't**:
- Use vague qualifiers ("probably," "might," "could possibly")
- Bury important details in fine print
- Mix metaphors ("hunting leads" + "harvesting opportunities" = confusing)
- Overuse exclamation marks (one per page maximum)
- Use unexplained acronyms on first mention
- Write long paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- Make promises without data to back them up

**Terminology Consistency**:
- "Scout" not "contributor," "provider," or "partner"
- "Lead" not "prospect," "contact," or "opportunity" (in user-facing copy)
- "Quality Score" not "rating," "ranking," or "grade"
- "Sold Lead" not "purchased lead" or "converted lead"
- "Payout" not "commission," "payment," or "earnings" (be consistent per context)

### 6.4 About/Mission Statement

**LeadScout: Connecting Scouts and Companies Through Trust**

In 2025, B2B lead generation is broken. Companies waste thousands on scraped databases and cold outreach while sales professionals sit on valuable networks they can't monetize.

LeadScout fixes this by creating a transparent marketplace where professional scouts earn fair compensation for high-quality lead submissions, and companies access pre-qualified prospects at predictable costs.

We believe authentic business relationships should create value for everyone involved. When a scout introduces a company to a qualified prospect, all three parties benefit - that's the foundation of our marketplace.

Our platform combines marketplace efficiency with quality standards: scouts earn 12.50-25€ per sold lead with weekly payouts, while companies pay 10-20€ per verified prospect - 80% less than traditional lead generation.

Built for the European B2B market, we prioritize transparency, data privacy (GDPR-compliant), and fair economics. Every lead is human-verified, every payout is guaranteed, and every relationship is built on trust.

**Mission**: To create the most trusted B2B lead marketplace in Europe by rewarding professional scouts and delivering quality leads to growing companies.

**Founded**: 2025 | **Headquarters**: Luxembourg | **Markets**: Luxembourg, France, Belgium

### 6.5 Value Proposition Statement

**One-Sentence Value Proposition**:
LeadScout is a B2B lead marketplace connecting professional scouts (who earn 12.50-25€ per qualified lead) with companies (who pay 10-20€ per human-verified prospect) - delivering quality at 80% lower cost than traditional lead generation.

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)**:
LeadScout is a two-sided marketplace for B2B leads. Professional scouts submit qualified prospects from their business networks and earn 12.50-25€ per sale with weekly payouts. Companies subscribe for 99-499€/month to access human-verified leads at 10-20€ each - that's 80% cheaper than LinkedIn ads. We've paid out 250,000€ to scouts and delivered 10,000+ leads to B2B companies across Luxembourg, France, and Belgium.

## 7. Competitor Differentiation

| Aspect | LeadScout | LinkedIn Sales Navigator | Lusha/Apollo.io | Lead Gen Agencies |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Lead Source** | Human scouts from real interactions | User searches LinkedIn database | Scraped databases | Cold outreach teams |
| **Verification** | Two-layer: Scout + Platform review | User validates manually | Automated scraping (often outdated) | Agency process (opaque) |
| **Pricing** | 99-499€/month subscription | 99€/month + InMail costs | 79-399€/month + per-credit fees | 2000-10,000€/month retainers |
| **Cost Per Lead** | 10-20€ per verified lead | 75-100€+ (time + InMail + ads) | 2-5€ (unverified contacts) | 50-150€ per lead |
| **Target Audience** | SMBs without prospecting teams | Sales teams doing outreach | Sales/marketing teams | Enterprises with budgets |
| **Quality Control** | Scout quality scores, conversion tracking | None (user-dependent) | Data accuracy scores only | Varies by agency |
| **Contract Terms** | Monthly, cancel anytime | Annual or monthly | Annual common | 3-6 month minimums |
| **Key Differentiator** | **Human-verified marketplace** | Research tool (not leads) | Data access (not verification) | Full-service (not self-serve) |

**Messaging Gaps to Exploit**:

1. **vs. Sales Navigator**: They provide search tools, we provide ready-to-contact leads
   - **Our Message**: "Stop searching. Start closing."

2. **vs. Lusha/Apollo**: They scrape outdated data, we verify through human scouts
   - **Our Message**: "Human-verified, not database-scraped"

3. **vs. Agencies**: They're opaque and expensive, we're transparent and affordable
   - **Our Message**: "Agency quality at marketplace prices"

4. **vs. All**: We're the only platform that rewards lead providers financially
   - **Our Message**: "A marketplace where everyone wins"

**Unique Value Proposition Statement**:
LeadScout is the only B2B lead marketplace that combines human verification with marketplace economics - scouts earn from their networks, companies save 80% on lead costs, and quality is guaranteed through transparent scoring systems.

### 9.4 Press Release Angle

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**LeadScout Launches B2B Lead Marketplace Connecting Professional Scouts with Growing Companies**

*Luxembourg-based startup enables sales professionals to monetize their networks while helping SMBs access quality leads at 80% lower costs*

LUXEMBOURG - [DATE] - LeadScout, a two-sided marketplace for B2B lead generation, today announced its launch in Luxembourg, France, and Belgium. The platform connects professional scouts who submit qualified leads from their business networks with companies seeking pre-verified prospects.

Unlike traditional lead generation agencies or database providers, LeadScout combines human verification with marketplace economics. Scouts earn 12.50-25€ per sold lead with weekly payouts, while companies access leads at 10-20€ each through monthly subscriptions starting at 99€.

"B2B lead generation is broken," said [Founder Name], CEO of LeadScout. "Companies waste budget on scraped databases with 5% conversion rates, while sales professionals sit on valuable networks they can't monetize. We're creating a marketplace where both sides win through transparency and quality."

The platform features a proprietary Quality Score system that tracks scout performance based on lead conversion rates and buyer feedback. Scouts with higher scores unlock premium lead categories and bonus payouts, ensuring consistent quality for companies.

Early beta testing shows 70%+ lead-to-opportunity conversion rates, compared to 5-15% industry averages for cold leads. Companies report 80% cost savings versus traditional lead generation methods.

LeadScout is currently accepting applications for its beta program, limited to 100 scouts and 20 companies.

For more information, visit [website] or contact [email].
